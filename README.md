# anonymisation-evaluator

Tool to evaluate the quality of an anonymisation algorithm on a GPS trajectory data set. The tool was developed as part of my bachelor's thesis (can be found [here](https://www.sts.tuhh.de/pw-and-m-theses/2018/kaiser18.pdf)) on *Trajectory Anonymisation by Multivariate Microaggregation* for evaluating the implemented algorithm.

The evaluation metrics implemented in this repository are mostly derived from those described by S. Martinez-Bea and V. Torra [[1]](#1).

Check out [jank324/trajectory-anonymisation](https://github.com/jank324/trajectory-anonymisation.git) for the implementation of the evaluated anonymisation algorithm.
